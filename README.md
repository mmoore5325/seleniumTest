This is my introduction to Selenium Web Browser testing.  Going to be
following some tutorials in it.  Hopefully I will learn something
and maybe you will too.

Chrome involved steps.  I initially received the error:
"unable to find the chromedriver executable."

I had to download the latest drivers here:
https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

Then you have to move that file to the correct folder.
I run Ubuntu 16.04, so it might be different for everyone.
But it needed to be in the user/bin folder.  This is the website that
guided me, and hopefully it can help you too.
